A 256-byte procedural graphics program for the Sega Dreamcast video game
console, released at Lovebyte 2025, originally written by Julien Verneuil.

Rewritten from the Javascript algorithm to C by Paul Cercueil, and heavily
modified to use floats instead of fixed-point and matrix multiplications to
speed up computations on the SH4.
