Parallax is my (Megan Potter) answer to wanting a nice, simple API with which to
write mostly-2D games for KOS. Brian Peek and I both needed something like this
which is faster (and cuts around much of the properness of things like KGL)
for our projects, and so we sat down and came up with a basic list of
requirements and specs, and I got to coding.
